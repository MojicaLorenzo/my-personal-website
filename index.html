             <p>I'm from a small city called Belle Glade, located in south Florida. Both my parents are immigrants, and I'm a first-generation graduate. I have two little sisters who look up to me and for whom I wish to set an example and maybe one day help inspire them to do what they love. As for me, I've always dreamed of creating stuff, hence why engineering was my first option when picking a career path. Things that I like to do in my free time are draw, read, and play video games, because who doesn't love video games?</p>
